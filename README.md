# Pokedot

## Description

The application contains 4 screen. I am still working on the app and hopefully before the meeting I
can finish some of the features

### Login screen

The login screen is to mock the login of a parent or a child when the parent log in the user will
see a Parent home page,
and if use the child login the user will see the Child home screen

### Parent Home screen
In the parent home screen, the user is welcomed with a random pokemon data and there are 2 buttons
also in the screen.
The 'Random button' wil enable the user to change the pokemon in the screen randomly
and the send to kids button is now not working as I have not implemented that feature

#### Whats pending

- Send to kids is not working as I have not implemented the persistence storage

### Children home screen

In the children home screen the user can view the list of all pokemons with a paginated view.
If the user click on any item /name in the list it will take the user to the detailed view.

#### Whats pending

- Pinned pokemon from the parents is absent

### Pokemon info screen

#### Whats pending
