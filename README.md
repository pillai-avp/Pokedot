# Pokedot

## Description

The application contains 4 screens. I am still working on the app, and hopefully, before the
meeting, I can finish some of the features.

### Login screen

When a parent logs in, they'll see the Parent home page, and if a child logs in, they'll see the
Child home screen.

### Parent Home screen

On the main screen, users will see random Pokemon data and two buttons. The "Random" button allows
users to change the displayed Pokemon randomly. The "Send to Kids" button is currently not
functional as this feature has not been implemented yet.

#### Whats pending

- Send to kids is not working as I have not implemented the persistence storage

### Children home screen

In the children's home screen, users can view a paginated list of all Pok√©mon. Clicking on any item
or name in the list will take the user to the detailed view.

#### Whats pending

- Pinned pokemon from the parents is absent

### Pokemon info screen

This screen have the detailed view about the specific pokemon.

#### Whats pending

- Need more information in the screen
