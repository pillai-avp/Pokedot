# Pokedot

## Description

The application contains 4 screen

### Login screen

The login screen is to mock the login of a parent or a child when the parent log in the user will
see a Parent home page,
and if use the child login the user will see the Child home screen

### Parent Home screen

In the parent home screen, the user is welcomed with a random pokemon data and there are 2 buttons
also in the screen.
The 'Random button' wil enable the user to change the pokemon in the screen randomly
and the send to kids button is now not working as I have not implemented that feature
